‚ÄúI Ain‚Äôt Worried‚Äù Lyrics:
i don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve been told
but time is running out no need to take it slow
im stepping to you toe to toe
i should be scared honey maybe so

but i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve been told
but time is running out so spend it like its gold
im living like I‚Äôm 9 zeros
got no regrets even when I‚Äôm broke
yeah
im at my best when i got something
im wanting to steal
way too busy for them problems
and problems to feel (yeah yeah)
no stressing just obsessin with sealin the deal
ill take it in and let it go

but i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

oooooooooo
i aint worried
oooooooo
oh no no

i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below
i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",low,"$70,136.9"

When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: ‚ÄúRooster,‚Äù the son of Maverick‚Äôs late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka ‚ÄúGoose.‚Äù Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.
